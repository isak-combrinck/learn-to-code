# Basic Git Usage - Practice
Try to do the following with what you know so far:
- Sign up for an account (if you don't already have one) on a git service like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Create a new project on said service.
- Clone the project you created to a folder on your computer.
- Create a readme in the folder, write something in it, and upload it to the server using the git commands that you learned.
- Go to the project you created on the service and check its files to see the readme online.

Celebrate! Then continue:
- Create a new branch and add a changelog (that's just a text file called changelog) to it.
- Switch back to the master branch and see what happened in your folder.
- Merge the branch you created with the master branch.

Be amazed at what you've accomplished.
