# Learn to Code

*An introduction to computer programming.*

This is a course that will teach you how to program. It assumes that you are a complete beginner and teaches you everything you need to know, step by step.

You will see that all parts of the course are numbered. The numbers show you the order in which go through the course.

An important part of this course is learning to learn from different sources. As a result we will use the following selection of paid courses in this course:

- [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

This course is not endorsed by the authors of the paid courses. I have simply picked them based on my experience, coaching people through the courses and seeing which ones actually make them a better programmer.
