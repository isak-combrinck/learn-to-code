# Introduction to HTML and CSS

The reason we learn HTML & CSS first is because no matter what direction you decide to go with programming, you will have to interact with them at one point or another. If you like being creative you will probably enjoy this part. If you despise creativity then think of it like ripping a band-aid off; just do the course and don't worry, there's plenty of logic to come.

The HTML & CSS part is covered by the Udemy course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). You will need to buy the course if you don't already have it. If you are tight for cash you can always wait until one of the Udemy sales, where you can mostly pick it up at an 80% discount.

Go ahead and do the course, it takes about a week if you do it full-time.
