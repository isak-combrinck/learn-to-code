# Introduction to JavaScript

Finally some *real* programming!

The JavaScript part is covered by the Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). You will need to buy the course if you don't already have it. If you are tight for cash you can always wait until one of the Udemy sales, where you can mostly pick it up at an 80% discount.

Go ahead and do the course, it takes about two weeks if you do it full-time. You can skip the *HTML and CSS Crash Course* section completely.
