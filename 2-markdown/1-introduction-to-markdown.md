### **What is Markdown?**
Markdown is a markup language that allows you to add formatting to text files. You can think of it as a shorthand for HTML because it compiles to HTML. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 and has since been extended into different *flavors*. More about the flavors later. Markdown is what I used to create this document, in fact this whole course is written in Markdown's `.md` files.

 We use Markdown for the various texts we have to write as programmers. This is because Markdown allows us to give our readmes, changelogs and documentation structure while not cluttering them with the extensive syntax that languages like HTML require. 

 A note on flavors. Markdown compiles to HTML but not all of the features of HTML are supported by its default syntax. You can add an HTML element anywhere in a Markdown file and it will still compile correctly, however, this creates an odd mix of Markdown and HTML. Because of this many people and companies have extended or altered the syntax of Markdown since it came out. These additions and alterations are called flavors. It doesn't really matter what flavor you use as long as you keep it consistent and know what one you used.

### **Start using Markdown**
 You can check out [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) to see some Markdown in its natural habitat. This is mostly the kid of stuff that you as a programmer will be using it for  in your day to day toils with the keyboard. I don't believe it necessary to practice Markdown as the syntax is really quite simple and the best way to practice it is by just starting to use it in your readmes, changelogs and documentation right away. That's it, just create a `.md` file and refer to the [syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to start writing in Markdown.
